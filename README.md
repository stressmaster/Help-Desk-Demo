## Next.js Help Desk demo

This is a quick demo of a help desk site built in Next.js

Clients can create, edit, and view their own tickets. Backend admins can view all tickets and respond to them, as well as update their status.

Emails are logged in the browser console whenever the backend admin adds comments to a client's ticket.
